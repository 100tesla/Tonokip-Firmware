Tonokip RepRap firmware rewrite based off of Hydra-mmm firmware.
	This fork is written with RAMPS in mind.
	It also provides additional functionality and G/M code support.
Tested on Arduino 18.
Rename configuration.h.dist to configuration.h and you are good to go if you have RAMPS 1.1 or 1.2.

TODO:
Store internal position using steps(long int) instead of units(float).
Work on chamber code.

Needs to be tested/verified, but should work(:
Thermocouple support.
M112
M116
M114
M115
M141

Note:
Tonokip originally wrote this firmware in early 2010. With improving reprap technologies, it was nessecary needed to add additional G code support. 
If anybody feels a code needs to be supported you can email me at tesla893@gmail.com or talk to me on the #reprap IRC, where my username is tesla893.
Most of what I am doing is maintenece and cleanup. Thanks to Tonokip, the Hydra-mmm team and the RepRap core team for all their work.
