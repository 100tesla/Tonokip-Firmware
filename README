This version is designed to work on the RAMPS.

TODO:
Inactivity timer failsafe that can be enabled/disabled by using a custom Mcode.
Max Endstop support (easy).
Store internal position using steps(long int) instead of units(float).
Test thermocouple support.
Work on implimenting and testing the M116 and M141 codes.
