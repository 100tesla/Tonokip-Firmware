Tonokip RepRap firmware rewrite based off of Hydra-mmm firmware.
	This fork is written with RAMPS in mind.
	It also provides additional functionality and G/M code support.

TODO:
Max Endstop support (easy).
Store internal position using steps(long int) instead of units(float).
Test thermocouple support.
Work on testing the M116 and M141 codes.


Note:
Tonokip originally wrote this firmware in early 2010. With improving reprap technologies, it was nessecary needed to add additional G code support. 
If anybody feels a code needs to be supported you can email me at tesla893@gmail.com or talk to me on the #reprap IRC, where my username is tesla893.
